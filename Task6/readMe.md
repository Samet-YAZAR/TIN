# Lab 6: JavaScript continued

###Assignment A

Create a folder named Assignment6 in your Cloud9 workspace.Write JS scripts listed below – one file should contain implementation of a single task + example of use, files named 6a.html + 6a.js (if a separate JS file is necessary), 6b.html + 6b.js and so on. Remember to write the necessary HTML code too.

a) Write a JS function that will convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit) , taking input from a form on the page and printing output to a field on the same page. Function should be invoked using HTML button.

b) Write a JS function that will add a paragraph of text to the page after 5 seconds from opening the page

c) Write a JS function to validate contents of a form – the form should have at least one mandatory numerical field and one field to be checked with a regular expression (e.g. an e-mail). Fields not passing validation should have their style modified to inform the user. The JS function should return false if form fails validation, true if it passes.

d) Write a JS function that will add a row to HTML table based on contents of a form on the same page. Function should be invoked using HTML button.

Not an actual assignment, but a good idea

Configure ESLint, use the ESLint recommended setting with added rule causing errors if statements are not terminated with semicolons. Check your solutions from this and previous labs using ESLint

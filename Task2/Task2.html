                          <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.
                           Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:
                           a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences,
                            a paragraph is half a page long, etc.</p>

                            <p> In reality,
                            though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences
                            is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as
                            “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit”
                            (Lunsford and Connors 116).  </p>

                            <p>Length and appearance do not determine
                             whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance,
                             in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles,
                             a paragraph can be just one sentence long.</p>

                             <p> Ultimately,
                             a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that
                             support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer
                             to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls
                             what happens in the rest of the paragraph.</p>

                             <p>Paragraph development continues with an expression of the
                               rationale or the explanation that the writer gives for
                               how the reader should interpret the information presented
                               in the idea statement or topic sentence of the paragraph.
                               The writer explains his/her thinking about the main topic,
                               idea, or focus of the paragraph. </p>
